# Todo

* **Fix the Date Problem**
* Look into more RSS feeds to return
* Create Universal Return, possibly its own method
* Add more of the easy api calls, then start parsing html :)
* Possibly add an option for all info, for sites that give more than just a verse (or page this idea for a later version)
